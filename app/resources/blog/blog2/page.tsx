            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold">What Are Cybersecurity Frameworks?</h2>
            <p>
              Cybersecurity frameworks are structured sets of guidelines, best practices, and standards
              designed to help organizations manage and mitigate cybersecurity risks. They provide a roadmap
              for implementing security controls, assessing risks, and ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements.
              These frameworks are essential for businesses looking to build a strong cybersecurity posture.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold">Top Industry-Standard Cybersecurity Frameworks</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)</li>
              <li>ISO/IEC 27001</li>
              <li>CIS Controls</li>
              <li>PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)</li>
              <li>COBIT (Control Objectives for Information and Related Technologies)</li>
              <li>HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold">Which Framework is the Most Used and Why?</h2>
            <p>The NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) is arguably the most widely used framework globally. Here’s why:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> It can be tailored to fit organizations of all sizes and industries.</li>
              <li><strong>Comprehensiveness:</strong> It covers all aspects of cybersecurity, from risk assessment to incident response.</li>
              <li><strong>Government Endorsement:</strong> Its adoption by U.S. federal agencies has spurred widespread use in the private sector.</li>
              <li><strong>Global Appeal:</strong> While developed in the U.S., the NIST CSF is used internationally due to its practicality and effectiveness.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold">How to Choose the Right Framework for Your Business</h2>
            <p>Selecting the right cybersecurity framework depends on several factors:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Industry Requirements:</strong> Some industries have mandatory frameworks (e.g., PCI DSS for payment processing, HIPAA for healthcare).</li>
              <li><strong>Organization Size:</strong> Smaller businesses may prefer simpler frameworks like CIS Controls, while larger enterprises may opt for NIST or COBIT.</li>
              <li><strong>Compliance Needs:</strong> If your organization operates globally, ISO 27001 might be the best choice due to its international recognition.</li>
              <li><strong>Risk Profile:</strong> Assess your organization’s specific risks and choose a framework that addresses them effectively.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold">Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
              Cybersecurity frameworks are essential tools for building a resilient defense against cyber threats.
              While the NIST CSF stands out as the most popular due to its flexibility and comprehensive approach,
              other frameworks like ISO 27001, CIS Controls, and PCI DSS are equally valuable depending on your industry and needs.
              By understanding these frameworks and their applications, businesses can make informed decisions to safeguard their
              digital assets and maintain customer trust.
